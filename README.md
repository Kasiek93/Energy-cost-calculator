**_,,Energy Calculator"_**

The application calculates how much we will pay for our electricity and gas bills.

If reading paper bills scares you, this is something that will make your life easier.

Application created in Create React App.

**Quick Overview**

If you've previously installed create-react-app globally via npm install -g create-react-app, we recommend you uninstall the package using npm uninstall -g create-react-app or yarn global remove create-react-app to ensure that npx always uses the latest version.


Then open http://localhost:3000/ to see your app.
When you’re ready to deploy to production, create a minified bundle with npm run build.

**Get Started Immediately**
You don’t need to install or configure tools like webpack or Babel.
They are preconfigured and hidden so that you can focus on the code.

Create a project, and you’re good to go.


**Creating an App**

To create a new app, you may choose one of the following methods:

**npx**
npx create-react-app my-app

**npm**
npm init react-app my-app

**Yarn**
yarn create react-app my-app

It will create a directory called my-app inside the current folder.
Inside that directory, it will generate the initial project structure and install the transitive dependencies.


No configuration or complicated folder structures, only the files you need to build your app.
Once the installation is done, you can open your project folder:

cd my-app
Inside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:

**npm start or yarn start**
Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.
You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

**npm test or yarn test**
Runs the test watcher in an interactive mode.
By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.

Read more about testing.

**npm run build or yarn build**
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

Your app is ready to be deployed.

You can find detailed instructions on using Create React App and many tips in its documentation.

**Why React App?**
_One Dependency:_ 
There is only one build dependency. It uses webpack, Babel, ESLint, and other amazing projects, but provides a cohesive curated experience on top of them.

_No Configuration Required:_
You don't need to configure anything. A reasonably good configuration of both development and production builds is handled for you so you can focus on writing code.

**Create React App is a great fit for:**

Learning React in a comfortable and feature-rich development environment.

Starting new single-page React applications.
